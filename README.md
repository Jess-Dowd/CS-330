## Reflection – CS 330 Portfolio

For this course, I uploaded both the 3D Scene ZIP folder and the Design Decisions document to my GitHub portfolio. These two files together show the progress I made in learning about 3D graphics, how I approached the development process, and the design decisions I had to make to finish the project. Below is my reflection on the work I did.

### How do I approach designing software?

When I design software I usually start with the core goals of what the software needs to do, then I break that into small pieces and figure out how those will work together. I focus on functionality first and worry about extra polish or optimization later. I also make sure to go back and improve things once I see how it’s all coming together.

### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project helped me think more visually. I had to understand how objects interact in 3D space and what makes something look realistic. I also got better at using modular design so that each part of the scene could be adjusted without messing up everything else.

### What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed the milestone structure and worked one piece at a time. First setting up a simple scene, then adding interactivity, textures, and lighting. I made changes after testing each piece and tried to make sure it was all stable before moving on.

### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I can reuse this strategy of building in steps and testing along the way for future projects. It helped keep things manageable and let me catch bugs early. Also, making the code modular helped a lot and I’ll continue doing that.

### How do I approach developing programs?

I like to start simple and then keep building on top of it. I test constantly to make sure things still work as I go. I also look up examples when I’m stuck and figure out how to tweak them for my own needs.

### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I learned to work with shaders and use external textures and lighting files to create more realistic scenes. I also got used to switching between files and checking how changes in one file affected the others. That was new for me.

### How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was a big part of the project. Each time I added something new, I had to go back and adjust something from before. Whether it was lighting, camera angles, or object placement, I had to test and tweak a lot.

### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

At first I was mostly focused on making it work at all. But by the end, I was more focused on how to make it cleaner and easier to manage. I started using better variable names, organizing my code better, and adding more comments so I could understand it later.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science helps me get closer to my career goals because I want to work with technology in a way that feels creative and hands-on. Building things like this project helps me get experience and gives me something real to show future employers.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Working with 3D graphics taught me how to think about objects in space, how rendering works, and how to solve visual bugs. These are all skills that will come in handy in other classes that involve visuals, games, or even data visualization.

### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

These skills could help me in jobs that deal with UI/UX, gaming, or any kind of visual development. Even if I don’t go into graphics, understanding how visuals are created and manipulated is a useful skill in a lot of software jobs.
